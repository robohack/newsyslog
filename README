NEWSYSLOG -- A portable and enhanced version of this old standard

This file:  Copyright (C) 1997 Planix, Inc. - All rights reserved.

This is an updated version of a package put together by Theodore Ts'o ,
of MIT Project Athena (which is included in NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
and probably other OS' too).

What does this newsyslog have to offer?

	- it has support for fixed time-of-day daily archiving.

	- it supports optional PID files so that non-standard daemons
	  can be told to re-open their logfiles after archiving has
	  taken place.

	- it can leave the most recently archived log file uncompressed

(For more specific details and recent changes see the NEWS file.)


TO BUILD NEWSYSLOG

If you are building newsyslog on a BSD-based system you can simply use
"Makfile.BSD".  This is in fact necessary if your system requires
installation of pre-formatted manual pages (otherwise you'll have to
install them by hand).  Copy "Makefile.BSD-dist" to "Makefile.BSD",
check and possibly update the default options in it then simply run:

	make -f Makefile.BSD

Newsyslog can also be built using the GNU Autoconf based build system
and a ``normal'' "make".

Please see the file "INSTALL" for overall instructions on how to
configure and build this package using the GNU Autoconf generated
"configure" script.

In general you need only run "./configure && make && make install"

You may choose to use GNU Zip in preference to the default compress
program as the archive compression too with:

	./configure --with-gzip

WARNING:  If you have previously configured newsyslog without the above
option and now wish to add it you will have to remove ./config.cache
first to prevent the wrong program pathname from being used.

Beware that you may need to specify exactly where your syslogd keeps
it's pid-file.  This can be done either by specifying an alternate
directory prefix to ./configure in this way ("/run/syslog.pid" will be
appended to the directory name given):

	./configure --localstatedir=/var

or by specifying an explicit pathname to ./configure in this way:

	./configure --with-syslog_pid=/var/run/mysyslog.pid

The default configuration file location can be modified by specifying an
alternate directory to ./configure in this way ("/newsyslog.conf will be
appended to the directory name given):

	./configure --sysconfdir=/etc

or by specifying an explicit pathname to ./configure in this way:

	./configure --with-newsyslog_conf=/etc/newsyslog.conf

Try './configure --help' for more options.
