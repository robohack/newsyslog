NEWSYSLOG -- A portable and enhanced version of this old standard

This file:  Copyright (C) 1997 Planix, Inc. - All rights reserved.

This is an updated version of a package put together by Theodore Ts'o ,
of MIT Project Athena (which is included in NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
and probably other OS' too).

What does this newsyslog have to offer?

	- it has support for fixed time-of-day daily archiving.

	- it supports optional PID files so that non-standard daemons
	  can be told to re-open their logfiles after archiving has
	  taken place.

	- it can leave the most recently archived log file uncompressed

(For more specific details and recent changes see the NEWS file.)


TO BUILD NEWSYSLOG

Please see the file "INSTALL" for overall instructions on how to
configure and build this package.

In general you need only run "./configure && make && make install"

You may choose to use GNU Zip in preference to the default compress
program as the archive compression too with:

	./configure --with-gzip

WARNING:  If you have previously configured newsyslog without the above
option and now wish to add it you will have to remove ./config.cache
first to prevent the wrong program pathname from being used.

Beware that you may need to specify exactly where your syslogd keeps
it's pid-file.  This can be done either by specifying an alternate
directory prefix to ./configure in this way ("/run/syslog.pid" will be
appended to the directory name given):

	./configure --localstatedir=/var

or by specifying an explicit pathname to ./configure in this way:

	./configure --with-syslog_pid=/var/run/mysyslog.pid

The default configuration file location can be modified by specifying an
alternate directory to ./configure in this way ("/newsyslog.conf will be
appended to the directory name given):

	./configure --sysconfdir=/etc

or by specifying an explicit pathname to ./configure in this way:

	./configure --with-newsyslog_conf=/etc/newsyslog.conf

Try './configure --help' for more options.
