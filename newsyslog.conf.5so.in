.Nm newsyslog
configuration file
.Sh "DESCRIPTION"
The
.Dq Pa @path_config@
file is the configuration file for the
.Nm newsyslog
program.  Each line of this file contains information about how a
particular log file should be handled by
.Nm newsyslog .
Each line has five mandatory fields and three optional fields, with a
whitespace separating each field.  Blank lines or lines beginning with
.Dq #
are ignored.  The fields of the configuration file are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar logfile_name
Name of the system log file to be archived.
.It Ar owner:group
This optional field specifies the owner and group for the archive file.
The colon-separated subfields may be numeric, or a name which is present
in
.Pa /etc/passwd
or
.Pa /etc/group
respectively.  Either of the file's user-id or group-id may be left
unchanged from the ownership of the current file by specifying it as
.Dq Li -1.
.It Ar mode 
Specifies the file permissions of the log file and its archival copies
in the standard three-digit octal format.
.It Ar count
Specify the number of archive files to be kept
besides the log file itself.
.It Ar size
When the size of the log file reaches the number of kilobytes specified
by
.Ar size ,
the log file will be trimmed as described above.  If this field
is replaced by a
.Ar * ,
then the size of the log file is not taken into account
when determining when to trim the log file.
.It Ar interval
The
.Ar when
field can consist of an interval, a specific time, or both.  If the
.Ar when
field is an asterisk
.Pq Ql \&*
log rotation will depend only on the contents of the
.Ar size
field.
.Pp
In the simple form of digits only they are interpreted as number of
hours.  When
.Ar interval
hours have passed, the log file will be trimmed.  Note that if this
value is an even multiple of 24 hours it may have special meaning
depending on the way
.Nm newsyslog
is invoked (see the description of the
.Fl m
and
.Fl M
options in the
.Xr newsyslog 8
manual page).  Note also that when the
.Fl m
and
.Fl M
options are not used, and when the
.Ar interval
is not evenly divisible by 24, log files will not be rolled over at the
same time of day.  In fact the roll-over time will probably creep around
the clock, unless it is followed by a time specification.
.Pp
A time specification to fix the log file's rotation at a specified time,
once per day, per week, or per month may also be given.  If it follows
an interval then it must be separated by a hyphen (i.e. a minus sign,
.Sq \- ) .
.Pp
.Em WARNING :
When a time specification is given for any log file
.Nm newsyslog
must be invoked with the
.Fl i
option to tell it at what interval it is being run so that it can
approximate the time of day calculations.  Note that one full minute is
subtracted from the interval to give the time range after which the
specification remains valid.  For example if an interval of 15 minutes
is specified then a time specification will match if the current time is
within 14 minutes
.Em after
the specified time.
.Pp
The daily, weekly, and/or monthly specification is given as:
.Sm off
.Bo
. Va D\&hh
.Bc ,
.Bo
. Va W\&w
. Bo
.  Va D\&hh
. Bc
.Bc 
and
.Bo
. Va M\&dd
. Bo
.  Va D\&hh
. Bc
.Bc
.Sm on
respectively (with letters in either uppercase or lowercase).  The
time-of-day fields, which are optional, default to midnight.  The ranges
and meanings for these specifications are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It Ar hh
hours, range 0 ... 23
.It Ar w
day of week, range 0 ... 6, 0 = Sunday
.It Ar dd
day of month, range 1 ... 31, or the letter
.Em L
or
.Em l
to specify the last day of the month.
.El
.Pp
Some examples:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It Ar D0
rotate every night at midnight
.It Ar D23
rotate every day at 23:00 hr
.It Ar W0D23
rotate every week on Sunday at 23:00 hr
.It Ar W5
rotate every week on Friday at midnight.
.It Ar MLD6
rotate at the last day of every month at 6:00 hr
.It Ar M5
rotate on every 5th day of month at midnight
.El
.Pp
If an interval
.Em and
a time specification are both given, then both conditions must be met.
I.e. the file must be as old or older than the specified interval, and
the current time must match the time specification.  This means that it
is most useful to specify just an hour of the day (eg.
.Ar D6 ,
for 6:00 hr) and an interval which is an even multiple of 24 hours.
.Pp
Normally the age of the log file will be determined by looking at the
last modification time of the most recent archive copy, if one exists.
If there is no archive copy, and the file is not marked as binary (see
the
.Ar B
flag below), then
.Nm newsyslog
will make a somewhat feeble attempt to read the time-stamp from the first
entry in the current log file (see the source for possible formats).
.Pp
The log file age has 30 minutes added to it in order to ensure that at a
regular interval (especially 24hr multiple) the file is likely to to
appear old enough to roll over.  This is mostly necessary for when the
archive copy may not exist and the initial entry may not have been made
right after log file roll-over.
.It Ar flags
This optional field specifies if the archive should have any
special processing done to the archived log files.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy D
The
.Ar D
flag prevents the creation of the new empty log file.  This can be
useful to avoid cluttering log directories with files that'll never be
used (though this flag should probably be avoided with daemons like
.Nm syslogd
which require the log file to exist prior to when they start); or when
the owner of the file writes any special start records to a new log file
that it creates.
.It Sy Z
The
.Ar Z
flag will make the archive files compress to save space by
using
.Nm compress
or
.Nm gzip ,
depending on which was selected at compile time.
.It Sy b
The
.Ar b
flag means that the file is a binary file, and so the
.Tn ASCII
message which
.Nm
inserts to indicate the fact that the logs have been
turned over should not be included.
.It Sy 0
The
.Ar 0
flag means that the most recent archive of the log file (i.e. the one that
ends in
.Dq Pa .0 )
should not be compressed even when the
.Ar Z
flag is given.  (This flag may also be specified as
.Ar P
for compatability with
.Nx . )
This flag is necessary when managing log files written
directly to by long-running processes (eg.\ 
.Nm smail ,
.Nm httpd ,
etc.).  This flag also makes it more convenient to browse through the
most recently archived log file without having to first uncompress it or
use tools like
.Nm zmore ,
or
.Nm zgrep ,
etc.
.It Sy -
The
.Ar -
flag means nothing, but can be used as a place-holder when either or
both of the
.Ar path_to_pid_file
and
.Ar sigtype
fields are specified for entries without any flags.
.El
.Pp
Flags can be specified in either uppercase or lowercase.
.It Ar path_to_pid_file
This optional field specifies the file name from which to read the
associated daemon's process-id.  If this field is present, and not
.Dq Pa /dev/null ,
a SIGHUP is sent the process id contained in this file.  This field must
start with a slash (i.e.\ 
.Dq Pa / )
in order to be recognised properly.
.It Ar sigtype
This optional field specifies the type of signal to be sent to the
daemon process.  This may be a numeric or symbolic value.  By default a
SIGHUP (hang-up) will be sent if this field is left blank.

.Sh "STANDARDS"
None.
.Sh "COMPATABILITY"
The original version of
.Nm newsyslog
expected a period
.Pq Dq "\&."
character to separate the user and group names in the
.Ar owner
field.  This has been changed to a colon
.Pq Dq "\:"
character so that user and group names may contain a period.  This
change is in conjunction with a similar change in the
.Nm chown
command (as required by
.St -p1003.2
compliance).  A period is no longer accepted as a separator as there are
already enough changes to make this version's configuration file format
incompatible with previous versions.
.Pp
The
.Fx
version
(and more recently the
.Nx
version) allows a restricted form of an ISO 8601 time format to specify
the time of day when a log file should be rotated.  In those versions
such a specification was given by placing it after an
.So Li \&@ Sc Ns No -sign
following the [optional] interval.  This version only allows the
sufficiently useful daily, weekly, and/or monthly time specification
(also innovated by
.Fx ) ,
but it uses the hyphen (\-) as a separator from the optional interval
instead of the more confusing
.So Li \&$ Sc Ns No -sign.

.Sh "BUGS"
.Pp
Fields such as
.Ar interval
and
.Ar size
should allow the units of measurement to be specified.
.Pp
There is no provision for specification of a timezone in the
.Ar interval
field.
.Pp
Listing the same
.Ar path_to_pid_file
multiple times will cause SIGHUP to be sent to the associated daemon
process for every log file with the same PID file which is rolled over.
This is done to ensure that it's safe to compress the file after it has
hopefully been closed but in theory should be optimised to only notify
daemon(s) once (and of course to batch all the compression commands to
the end of the process).  This behaviour is normally harmless for
.Nm syslogd
and multiple signals can be avoided for other daemons by ensuring their
PID files are only listed once and that the
.Ar 0
flag is used to ensure the most recent log file is not immediately
compressed.
.Pp
The age of the log file may be impossible to determine, especially for
binary format files, if the most recent archive copy
.Pa ( logfile.0* )
does not exist.
.Pp
Anyone messing with the modification time of the most recent archive
copy will possibly break the file age determination algorithm and thus
mess up regular archive intervals for such files.
