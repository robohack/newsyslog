.Sh NAME
.Nm newsyslog
.Nd maintain system log files to manageable sizes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm newsyslog
.Op Fl m Li | Fl M
.Op Fl rnv
.Op Fl f Ar config_file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Newsyslog
is a program that should be scheduled to run periodically by
.Xr cron 8 .
When it is executed it archives log files if necessary.  If a log file
is determined to require archiving, 
.Nm
rearranges the files so that ``logfile'' is empty, ``logfile.0'' has the
last period's logs in it, ``logfile.1'' has the next to last period's
logs in it, and so on, up to a user-specified number of archived logs.
The archived logs may also be compressed to save space.  After all file
operations are done
.Nm
notifies the
.Nm syslogd
daemon, and optionally other log-file specific daemons, by sending a
SIGHUP to the daemon process(es).
.Pp
A log can be archived because of two reasons.  The log file can have
grown bigger than a preset size in kilobytes, or a preset number of
hours may have elapsed since the last log archive.  The granularity of
.Nm
is dependent on how often it is scheduled to run by
.Xr cron 8 .
Since the program is quite fast, it may be scheduled to run at least
every hour without any ill effects, which will achieve near the maximum
granularity for elapsed time specification.  More frequent runs may be
necessary to catch extremely fast growing log files.
.Pp
When starting up, 
.Nm
reads in a configuration file to determine which logs should be looked
at.  By default, this configuration file is
.Pa  .
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options can be used with newsyslog:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f Ar config_file
Instruct newsyslog to use 
.Ar config_file
instead of
.Pa @path_config@
for its configuration file.
.It Fl v
Place 
.Nm
in verbose mode.  In this mode it will print out each log and its
reasons for either trimming that log or skipping it.
.It Fl m
Cause
.Nm
to trim log files which have an
.Ar interval
specified as an even multiple of 24 hours as well as any which may have
grown beyond their allowed size.  I.e. do the ``midnight'' archiving of
logs that must be archived at the same time every day or every
.Ar N
days.  You probably only want to specify this option for one invocation
per 24 hours and you probably want to use the corresponding
.Fl M
flag on all other periodic invocations.
.It Fl M
Prevent
.Nm
from trimming log files which do not have an
.Ar interval
specified as an even multiple of 24 hours.
.It Fl n
Cause
.Nm
not to trim the logs, but to print on its standard output what it would
do if this option were not specified.  If used without the
.Fl v
(verbose) flag the result should be a shell script that would duplicate
the actions of
.Nm
were it to be run without the
.Fl n
flag (and assuming of course the script were run by root).
.It Fl r
Remove the restriction that
.Nm
must be running as root.  Of course, 
.Nm
will not be able to send a HUP signal to
.Xr syslogd 8
or most other daemons so this option is probably only useful for
debugging.

.Sh HISTORY
Originated at MIT Project Athena.
.Pp
Someone at OSF hacked on it too.
.Pp
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Pp
There was an extremely simple shell script of similar purpose,
.Pa /usr/lib/newsyslog ,
in SunOS-4.1.

.Sh BUGS
The 
.Fl m
and
.Fl M
options do not allow for archiving on intervals other than multiples of
days (which is only slightly better than the default hourly interval).
.Pp
When the
.Fl m
and
.Fl M
options are not in use, and when the time period is not evenly divisible
by 24, log files that are archived based on a time period will not be
rolled over at the same time of day.  In fact the roll-over time will
creep around the clock.
.Pp
Sends SIGHUP to the associated daemon process for every log file
trimmed.  This is done to ensure that it's safe to compress the file
after it has hopefully been closed but in theory should be optimized to
only notify daemon(s) once.
