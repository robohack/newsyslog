.Sh NAME
.Nm newsyslog
.Nd maintain system log files to manageable sizes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm newsyslog
.Op Fl rnv
.Op Fl f Ar config_file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Newsyslog
is a program that should be scheduled to run periodically by
.Xr cron 8 .
When it is executed it archives log files if necessary.  If a log file
is determined to require archiving, 
.Nm
rearranges the files so that ``logfile'' is empty, ``logfile.0'' has the
last period's logs in it, ``logfile.1'' has the next to last period's
logs in it, and so on, up to a user-specified number of archived logs.
The archived logs may also be compressed to save space.  After all file
operations are done
.Nm
notifies the
.Nm syslogd
daemon and optionally other log-file specific daemons.
.Pp
A log can be archived because of two reasons.  The log file can have
grown bigger than a preset size in kilobytes, or a preset number of
hours may have elapsed since the last log archive.  The granularity of
.Nm
is dependent on how often it is scheduled to run by
.Xr cron 8 .
Since the program is quite fast, it may be scheduled to run at least
every hour without any ill effects, which will achieve near the maximum
granularity for elapsed time specification.  More frequent runs may be
necessary to catch extremely fast growing log files.
.Pp
When starting up, 
.Nm
reads in a configuration file to determine which logs should be looked
at.  By default, this configuration file is
.Pa /etc/newsyslog.conf .
Each line of the file contains information about a particular log file
that should be handled by
.Nm newsyslog .
Each line has five mandatory fields and three optional fields, with a
whitespace separating each field.  Blank lines or lines beginning with
``#'' are ignored.  The fields of the configuration file are as
follows: 
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar logfile_name
Name of the system log file to be archived.
.It Ar owner.group
This optional field specifies the owner and group for the archive file.
The subfields may be numeric, or a name which is present in
.Pa /etc/passwd
or
.Pa /etc/group .
.It Ar mode 
Specifies the file permissions of the log file and its archival copies
in the standard three-digit octal format.
.It Ar count
Specify the number of archive files to be kept
besides the log file itself.
.It Ar size
When the size of the log file reaches the number of kilobytes specified
by
.Ar size ,
the log file will be trimmed as described above.  If this field
is replaced by a
.Ar * ,
then the size of the log file is not taken into account
when determining when to trim the log file.
.It Ar interval
When 
.Ar interval
hours have passed, the log file will be trimmed.  If this field is
replaced by a
.Ar * ,
then the number of hours since the last time the log was
trimmed will not be taken into consideration.
.It Ar flags
This optional field specifies if the archive should have any
special processing done to the archived log files.
.Pp
The
.Ar Z
flag will make the archive files compress to save space by
using
.Xr compress 1
or
.Xr gzip 1 ,
depending on which was selected at compile time.
.Pp
The
.Ar B
flag means that the file is a binary file, and so the
.Tn ASCII
message which
.Nm
inserts to indicate the fact that the logs have been
turned over should not be included.
.Pp
The
.Ar -
flag means nothing, but can be used as a placeholder when the
field
.Ar path_to_pid_file
is specified for entries without any flags.
.It Ar path_to_pid_file
This optional field specifies the file name to read to find the daemon
process id.  If this field is present, a SIGHUP is sent the process id
contained in this file.  This field must start with a slash (``/'') in
order to be recognized properly.
.El
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options can be used with newsyslog:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f Ar config_file
Instruct newsyslog to use 
.Ar config_file
instead of
.Pa /etc/newsyslog.conf
for its configuration file.
.It Fl v
Place 
.Nm
in verbose mode.  In this mode it will print out each log and its
reasons for either trimming that log or skipping it.
.It Fl n
Cause
.Nm
not to trim the logs, but to print on its standard output what it would
do if this option were not specified.  If used without the
.Fl v
(verbose) flag the result should be a shell script that would duplicate
the actions of
.Nm
were it to be run without the
.Fl n
flag (and assuming of course the script were run by root).
.It Fl r
Remove the restriction that
.Nm
must be running as root.  Of course, 
.Nm
will not be able to send a HUP signal to
.Xr syslogd 8
or most other daemons so this option should only be used in debugging.

.Bl -tag -width /etc/newsyslog.confxxxx -compact

.Sh HISTORY
Originated at MIT Project Athena.
.Pp
Someone at OSF hacked on it too.
.Pp
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Pp
The
.Ar path_to_pid_file
optional field was added by FreeBSD.
.Pp
There was an extremely simple shell script of similar purpose,
.Pa /usr/lib/newsyslog ,
in SunOS-4.1.
.Sh BUGS
Log files will not be rolled over at the same time of day unless
.Nm
is run only once per day at a regular time.  In fact the roll-over time
will creep around the clock.  This could be overcome by adding an
optional
.Ar time_to_archive
subfield to the
.Ar interval
field (eg.  ``168@Sun:00'' to roll over Sunday at midnight).
.Pp
Fields such as
.Ar interval
and
.Ar size
should allow the units of measurement to be specified.
.Pp
There should be a separate
.Xr newsyslog.conf 5
manual page.
.Pp
If compression is turned on after the series of archival copies has been
created, old uncompressed archives will not be compressed.
