.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Newsyslog
is a program that should be scheduled to run periodically by
.Nm cron .
When it is executed it archives log files if necessary.  If a log file
is determined to require archiving, 
.Nm
rearranges the files so that
.Dq Pa log_file
is empty,
.Dq Pa log_file.0
has the last period's logs in it,
.Dq Pa log_file.1
has the next to last period's logs in it, and so on, up to a
user-specified number of archived logs.  The archived logs may also be
compressed to save space.  After all file operations are done
.Nm
notifies the
.Nm syslogd
daemon, or optionally some log-file specific daemon, by sending a
.Dv SIGHUP
to the daemon process.
.Pp
A log can be archived because of two reasons.  The log file can have
grown bigger than a preset size in kilobytes, or a preset number of
hours may have elapsed since the last log archive.  The granularity of
.Nm
is dependent on how often it is scheduled to run by
.Nm cron .
Since the program is quite fast, it may be scheduled to run at least
every ten minutes without any ill effects.  However even more frequent
runs may be necessary to catch extremely fast growing log files when
files are trimmed by size, and
.Nm
may be run as often as every minute without harm to facilitate this need.
.Pp
When starting up, 
.Nm
reads in a configuration file to determine which logs should be looked
at.  By default, this configuration file is
.Pa @path_config@ .
Note that a POSIX advisory lock is obtained on the configuration file
using the
.Xr open 2
.Dv O_EXLOCK
flag.  This both prevents simultaneous execution of
.Nm
using the same configuration file, as well as preventing the reading of
the file while it is being modified by any text editor which uses the
same locking feature (for example
.Xr vi 1 ) .
.Pp
If any
.Ar log_file
parameters are given then processing is restricted to just the specified
files.  The control specifications for the specified files are taken
from the configuration file.  Any files specified which do not
correspond to entries in the configuration file will be ignored.
.\"
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options can be used with newsyslog:
.Bl -tag -width 12345678
.It Fl d
Place
.Nm
into debug mode.  No actions will be performed.  If the
.Fl v
option is also given then messages about what would be done will be
printed without doing anything.  Repeat
.Fl d
to debug all archive rollovers even if they don't yet exist.  Use of
this option implies
.Fl r
too.
.It Fl f Ar config_file
Instruct
.Nm
to use
.Ar config_file
instead of
.Pa @path_config@
for its configuration file.
.It Fl F
Force
.Nm
to trim log files immediately.  Note that the
.Fl M
and
.Fl m
options are not ignored thus making it possible to force trimming of
only interval controlled logs.
.Pp
This option can be useful to initialize a freshly installed system with
initial archive copies to ensure reliable interval calculation based on
the age of the most recent archive file.  This option can also be useful
to mark an important system milestone in all logs
.Nm
manages.
.It Fl i Ar run_interval
Specify the interval, in minutes, between runs of
.Nm
by
.Nm cron .
This option is necessary if the configuration file contains any
.Ar interval
field values which contain roll-over time specifications (i.e. time of
day, week, or month).  If you are running
.Nm
by hand then just specify an interval of
.Em 1 .
The
.Fl i
option is preferred over the
.Fl m
and
.Fl M
options as this is the only way time-of-day specifications as the trim
interval are supported.
.It Fl m
Cause
.Nm
to trim log files which have an
.Ar interval
specified as an even multiple of 24 hours as well as any which may have
grown beyond their allowed size.  I.e. do the
.Dq midnight
archiving of logs that must be archived at the same time every day or
every
.Ar N
days.  You probably only want to specify this option for one invocation
per 24 hours and you probably want to use the corresponding
.Fl M
flag on all other periodic invocations.
.Pp
This option is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
.It Fl M
Prevent
.Nm
from trimming log files which have an
.Ar interval
specified as an even multiple of 24 hours (i.e. the ones that would be
archived when the
.Fl m
option is given).
.Pp
This option is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
.It Fl n
Cause
.Nm
not to trim the logs, but to print on its standard output what it would
do if this option were not specified.  The result should be a shell
script that would duplicate the actions of
.Nm
were it to be run without the
.Fl n
flag.  Use of this option implies
.Fl r
too.
.It Fl p Ar syslogd_pidfile
Instruct newsyslog to use 
.Ar syslogd_pidfile
instead of
.Pa @syslogd_pidfile@
as the PID file for
.Nm syslogd .
.It Fl r
Remove the restriction that
.Nm
must be running as root.  Of course, 
.Nm
will not be able to send a HUP signal to
.Nm syslogd
or most other daemons so this option is probably only useful for
debugging unless an alternate configuration file is specified.
.It Fl T Ar HH:MM
Pretend the current time is
.Ar HH:MM
instead of the current time.  The time given is always treated as a
future time.  This option is mostly useful for testing configurations.
.It Fl v
Place 
.Nm
in verbose mode.  In this mode it will print out each log and its
reasons for either trimming that log or skipping it.

.Sh HISTORY
Originated at MIT Project Athena.
.Pp
Someone at OSF hacked on it too.
.Pp
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Pp
There was an extremely simple shell script of similar purpose,
.Pa /usr/lib/newsyslog ,
in SunOS-4.1.
.Pp
This particular version's feature set, and this separate manual page for
the configuration file, was put together by
.An Greg A. Woods ,
Planix, Inc.

.Sh BUGS
When the
.Fl m
and
.Fl M
options, or the
.Fl i
option, are not in use, and when the time period is not evenly divisible
by 24, log files that are archived based on a time period will not be
rolled over at the same time of day.  In fact the roll-over time will
likely creep around the clock.
.Pp
.Nm
sends SIGHUP to the associated daemon process for every log file
trimmed.  This is done to ensure that it's safe to compress the file
after it has hopefully been closed.  In theory we could try to optimize
this procedure to only notify the daemon(s) once (and of course to batch
all the compression commands at the end of the run).  The current
behaviour is normally harmless for
.Nm syslogd
and multiple signals can be avoided for other daemons by ensuring their
PID files are only listed once with the last associated log file and
that the
.Ar 0
flag is used to ensure the most recent log file is not immediately
compressed.  Note that daemons which have multiple log files open may
requirer signalling every time any one of their logs are rolled over
anyway, especially if their different logs have different roll-over
policies.
