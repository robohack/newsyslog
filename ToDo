NEWSYSLOG ToDo -- Things that could be fixed/improved/added.

- Add one more optional field:  the format of the turnover message, with
  the default to be the "syslog" style:

	Mar 15 00:00:01 most newsyslog[17295]: logfile turned over

  Nothing fancy though.  Just strftime() formats, plus one magic
  specifier to represent where the hostname goes (%@), and another magic
  specifier for the "newsyslog[17295]: logfile turned over" part (%#).
  (i.e. run the format specifier through a simple replacement editor for
  the two magic strings, and then pass it to strftime()).  The default
  would thus be something like this:

	"%b %d %T %@ %#"

- Reverse the order of operations when checking the age of the log file
  such that the timestamp is always read from the first record of
  non-binary log files using the turnover format as a guide.  Only
  binary files will revert to checking the age of the .0 file.  This
  will make newsyslog less sensitive to the affects of anyone messing
  with the archive copies, and more accurate for the first go-around on
  non-syslog format log files.

  One possible limitation here is that the timestamp may have to appear
  at the beginning of the line (with only constant characters before and
  within it).  The only way around this might be to iterate strptime()
  starting at each successive character in the string to try and find a
  parsable date format that matches the turnover format as it would be
  with the two magic strings stripped off.

  For example the standard syslog format "%b %d %T %@ %#" would strip
  down to "%b %d %T ", which would hopefully match at offset 0 into the
  first log entry.

  An HTTP Common Log Format turnover message output format might be:

	"%@ - - [%Y/%m/%d:%T] \"%#\""

  This would have to be stripped down to the following for strptime():

	"%Y/%m/%d:%T] \""
