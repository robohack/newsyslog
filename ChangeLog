This file is effectively empty on purpose.  It exists merely to satisfy
automake, and as a pointer to the real code change documentation.

If you want to see all the code change comments, please use the
annonymous CVS server access at robohack.planix.com.  Oh, wait, it doesn't
exist yet!  I guess you'll have to bug me about it.
