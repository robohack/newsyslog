.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm newsyslog.conf
.Nd
.Xr newsyslog 8
configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm syslog.conf
file is the configuration file for the
.Xr newsyslog 8
program.
Each line of this file contains information about how a particular log
file should be handled by
.Xr newsyslog 8 .
Each line has five mandatory fields and three optional fields, with a
whitespace separating each field.  Blank lines or lines beginning with
.Dq #
are ignored.  The fields of the configuration file are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar logfile_name
Name of the system log file to be archived.
.It Ar owner.group
This optional field specifies the owner and group for the archive file.
The subfields may be numeric, or a name which is present in
.Pa /etc/passwd
or
.Pa /etc/group .
.It Ar mode 
Specifies the file permissions of the log file and its archival copies
in the standard three-digit octal format.
.It Ar count
Specify the number of archive files to be kept
besides the log file itself.
.It Ar size
When the size of the log file reaches the number of kilobytes specified
by
.Ar size ,
the log file will be trimmed as described above.  If this field
is replaced by a
.Ar * ,
then the size of the log file is not taken into account
when determining when to trim the log file.
.It Ar interval
When 
.Ar interval
hours have passed, the log file will be trimmed.  If this field is
replaced by a
.Ar * ,
then the number of hours since the last time the log was
trimmed will not be taken into consideration.  Note that if this value
is an even multiple of 24 hours it may have special meaning (see the
description of
.Fl m
and
.Fl M
in the
.Xr newsyslog 8
manual page).
.Pp
Normally the age of the log file will be determined by looking at the
last modification time of the most recent archive copy, if one exists.
If there is no archive copy, and the file is not marked as binary (see
the
.Ar B
flag below), then
.Nm newsyslog
will make a somewhat feeble attempt to read the time-stamp from the first
entry in the current log file (see the source for possible formats).
.Pp
The log file age has 30 minutes added to it in order to ensure that at a
regular interval (especially 24hr multiple) the file is likely to to
appear old enough to roll over.  This is mostly necessary for when the
archive copy may not exist and the initial entry may not have been made
right after log file roll-over.
.It Ar flags
This optional field specifies if the archive should have any
special processing done to the archived log files.
.Pp
The
.Ar Z
flag will make the archive files compress to save space by
using
.Xr compress 1
or
.Xr gzip 1 ,
depending on which was selected at compile time.
.Pp
The
.Ar B
flag means that the file is a binary file, and so the
.Tn ASCII
message which
.Nm
inserts to indicate the fact that the logs have been
turned over should not be included.
.Pp
The
.Ar 0
flag means that the most recent archive of the log file (i.e. the one that
ends in
.Dq Pa .0 )
should not be compressed even when the
.Ar Z
flag is given.  This flag is necessary when managing log files written
directly to by long-running processes (eg.\ 
.Xr smail 8 ,
.Xr httpd 8 ,
etc.).  This flag also makes it more convenient to browse through the
most recently archived log file without having to first uncompress it or
use tools like
.Xr zmore 1 ,
or
.Xr zgrep 1 ,
etc.
.Pp
The
.Ar -
flag means nothing, but can be used as a place-holder when the
field
.Ar path_to_pid_file
is specified for entries without any flags.
.It Ar path_to_pid_file
This optional field specifies the file name from which to read the
associated daemon's process-id.  If this field is present, and not
.Dq Pa /dev/null ,
a SIGHUP is sent the process id contained in this file.  This field must
start with a slash (i.e.\ 
.Dq Pa / )
in order to be recognized properly.

.Sh EXAMPLE
.Pp
A configuration file might appear as follows:
.Bd -literal
.so newsyslog.conf
.Ed
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width @path_config@ -compact
.It Pa @path_config@
The
.Xr newsyslog 8
configuration file.
.It Pa @syslog_pidfile@
The default location of the PID for
.Xr syslogd 8 .

.Xr gzip 1 ,
.Xr newsyslog 8 ,

.Xr syslogd 8
.Sh STANDARDS
None.
.Sh HISTORY
Originated at MIT Project Athena.
.Pp
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Pp
The
.Ar path_to_pid_file
optional field was added by FreeBSD.

.Sh BUGS
.Pp
Fields such as
.Ar interval
and
.Ar size
should allow the units of measurement to be specified.
.Pp
Are there any logfile generating daemons in use out there which do not
recognize SIGHUP as the signal to reopen their log files?  If so then
perhaps the
.Ar path_to_pid_file
field could be followed by yet another optional field to specify the
appropriate signal number.
.Pp
The age of the log file may be impossible to determine, especially for
binary format files, if the most recent archive copy (file.0*) does not
exist.
.Pp
Anyone messing with the modification time of the most recent archive
copy will possibly break the file age determination algorithm and thus
mess up regular archive intervals for such files.
