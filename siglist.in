#ident	"@(#)newsyslog:siglist.in:$Format:%D:%ci:%cN:%h$"
#
# List of all possible known signals from all types of systems.
#
# This list is used to initialize sys_signame signal table with the
# actual list of signal names used on the target host system.  It
# could also be used to build sys_siglist if necessary.
#
# Format of each entry is a signal name without the "SIG" prefix, and
# normally in all upper case to match the manifest constants defining
# signal names, followed by whitespace and then a text string
# describing the signal.
#
# Comments are any line starting with optional whitespace and a '#'.
#
# Blank lines and comment lines are ignored.
#
# Note that if a system has multiple defines for the same signal
# (eg, SIGABRT vs SIGIOT, SIGCHLD vs SIGCLD), only the first one
# will be seen, so the order in this list is important.
#
# This list is borrowed from siglist.in included in the PD-KSH
# sources, apparently first written by Michael Rendell
# <michael@panda.cs.mun.ca>

HUP    Control TTY hangup
INT    Control TTY interrupt
