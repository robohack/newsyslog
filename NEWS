* User-visible changes new in newsyslog-1.0.97.

- improved error messages by including line numbers.

- new optional "sigtype" field (ala NetBSD).

- POSIX demands that user and group values for chmod be separated by
  colons (since `.' *could* be legal in a user-name), so now the
  optional second field must similarly be separated into user and group
  sub-fields with a colon (`:').

- various bug fixes.

* User-visible changes new in newsyslog-1.0.96.

- just bug fixes.

* User-visible changes new in newsyslog-1.0.95.

- just bug fixes.

* User-visible changes new in newsyslog-1.0.94.

- improved usefulness of '-n'.  It now output strictly a shell script
  that would mimic actions without '-n'.  All extra information is only
  output with '-v' now.

- bug fixes.

* User-visible changes new in newsyslog-1.0.93.

- added '-p syslogd_pidfile' option (as in FreeBSD)

- lots of internal cleanups, logic fixes, portability fixes, etc.

* User-visible changes new in newsyslog-1.0.92.

- added '-F' (force) flag as in FreeBSD's latest version (rev.1.16)

- native BSD builds are supported without requiring ./configure.

- PID file can be /dev/null to avoid notifying any daemon.

- the '0' flag actually works (instead of just showing that it would
  work in verbose mode).

- a better attempt is made to determine the age of the log file when no
  log.0* file exists (by attempting to parse the timestamp from the
  first record of the current log file).  (WARNING:  Some (all?)
  versions of NetBSD have a buggy strptime(3) library routine that will
  make this less accurate.  PR# lib/5161 contains a patch.)

* User-visible changes new in newsyslog-1.0.91.

- none

* User-visible changes new in newsyslog-1.0.90.

- added '0' flag to leave logfile.0 uncompressed.

* User-visible changes new in newsyslog-0.1.91.

- don't add status message to new log file in order to ensure that
stagnant log files stay unchanged (i.e. the "empty" check prevents them
from being rolled over unnecessarily).

* User-visible changes new in newsyslog-0.1.80.

- added -M|-m option
- separated out newsyslog.conf.5 manual page
- improved documentation
